# dev-from-scratch
A journey of my dev life as I re-introduce some new and old skills!

<p>This project documents my journey as I go through a full-stack development program, working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and applying what I've learned at the associated agency.</p>

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<p><strong>Tech used:</strong> MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js</p>

<p>This project is a comprehensive demonstration of my skills and knowledge acquired during my full-stack development program. It includes various projects and applications that I have built from scratch, showcasing the use of the MERN stack.</p>

<h3>Project Structure:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. Implemented RESTful APIs to manage data and perform CRUD operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Developed with React, utilizing hooks and state management to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Implemented user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure routes and resources.</li>
    <li><strong>CRUD Operations:</strong> Full implementation of Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for various data models.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensured that all applications are mobile-friendly and responsive across different devices.</li>
    <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Used Context API and Redux for managing application state in complex applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

<p>In this section, I highlight some of the key optimizations made to improve the performance and scalability of my applications:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Database Indexing:</strong> Implemented indexing in MongoDB to speed up query performance, especially for large datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Splitting:</strong> Used Reactâ€™s code splitting and lazy loading to reduce initial load times and improve application performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Caching:</strong> Implemented caching strategies for both frontend and backend to reduce unnecessary database calls and improve response times.</li>
    <li><strong>Component Reusability:</strong> Ensured that React components are reusable and modular, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.</li>
</ul>

<p>These optimizations not only improved the performance of my applications but also provided valuable learning experiences in writing efficient and scalable code.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Throughout this project, I encountered numerous learning moments that contributed to my growth as a developer:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> Gained a comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend development, allowing me to build complete web applications from scratch.</li>
    <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Learned effective techniques for managing state in React applications, including the use of Context API and Redux.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> Improved my skills in designing and optimizing database schemas to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>API Development:</strong> Gained experience in designing and implementing RESTful APIs, including best practices for error handling and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):</strong> Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment, ensuring that my applications are always up-to-date and reliable.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiences have made me a more skilled and thoughtful developer, and I am excited to continue applying these lessons to future projects.</p>
